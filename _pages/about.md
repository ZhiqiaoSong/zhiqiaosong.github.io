Zhiqiao Song 🌻
======
Welcome! I'm Zhiqiao 👋 Thanks for visiting me webpage.

## About me

I am currently a fourth-year Ph.D. Candidate in the Department of Statstics and Actuarial Science at the [University of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca/statistics-and-actuarial-science/), specializing in Actuarial Science and Quantitative Finance.
I am very fortunate to be supervised by [Prof. Jun Cai](https://sas.uwaterloo.ca/~jcai/). 
My current research focuses on distributional model uncertainty with applications in finance and insurance.

I obtained my master's degree in Financial Technology (FinTech) from [Imperial College London (IC)](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/), United Kingdom, where I worked on the diversification effect, heavy-tailedness, and risk management.

I obtained a double Bachelor's degree in Actuarial Science and Actuarial Mathematics through a joint program offered by [Xi'anJiaotong-Liverpool University (XJTLU)](https://www.xjtlu.edu.cn/en), China, and the [University of Liverpool](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/), United Kingdom.


## My research interests include:

* Model uncertainty with applications to robust portfolio management

* Data-driven methods for distributionally robust optimization
  
* Optimal insurance/reinsurance design

* ESG-constrained investment strategies
  
* Peer-to-peer risk sharing and decentralized finance
