Zhiqiao Song 🌻
======
Welcome! I'm Zhiqiao 👋 Thanks for visiting me webpage.

## About me

I am a currently a fourth year Ph.D. Candidate in the Department of Statstics and Actuarial Science at the University of Waterloo. 
I am very fortunate to be supervised by [Prof. Jun Cai](https://sas.uwaterloo.ca/~jcai/). 
My current research focuses on distributional model uncertainty with applications in finance and insurance.

I obtained my master's degree in Financial Technology (FinTech) from Imperial College London (IC), United Kingdom, where I worked on diversification effect, heavy-tailedness and risk management.

I obtained a double Bachelor's degree in Actuarial Science and Actuarial Mathematics through a joint program offered by [Xi'anJiaotong-Liverpool University (XJTLU)](https://www.xjtlu.edu.cn/en), China, and the University of Liverpool, United Kingdom.


## My research interests include:

* Model uncertainty with applications to robust portfolio management

* ESG-constrained investment strategies
  
* Optimal insurance/reinsurance design
  
* Data-driven methods for distributionally robust optimization
  
* Peer-to-peer risk sharing and decentralized finance
